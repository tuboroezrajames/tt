--WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

--1A)Provide descriptive analytics that presents the number of observations of companies operating in financial services?
--answer: total of 99 companies operating in financial services

SELECT market,COUNT(status)AS companies_operating_in_financial_services 
FROM public.finserv_new
WHERE status = 'operating'
GROUP BY market;

--1B) average seed funding
--answer: 474725.71 average seed funding

SELECT market,ROUND(AVG(seed),2) AS average_seed_funding 
FROM public.finserv_new
GROUP BY market;

--1C)the standard deviation for the seed fundingâ€“both minimum and maximum?

SELECT funding_total_usd,seed,(seed-AVG(seed)OVER())/ STDDEV (seed)OVER() AS ZSCORE_SEED  
FROM public.finserv_new
ORDER BY ZSCORE_SEED ;



--2A)determine whether there has been a previous instance where a start-up company offering financial services received equity crowdfunding?

--option1

SELECT funding_total_usd,founded_year,equity_crowdfunding
FROM public.finserv_new

--option2
SELECT DISTINCT equity_crowdfunding 
FROM public.finserv_new;


--2B)provide details of the company such as the country it operates in, the year it was founded, its status
--(whether or not it is still operating), and the amount of equity crowdfunding it acquired

--viewing all the information about equity_crowdfunding

SELECT * FROM public.finserv_new
WHERE equity_crowdfunding =398097;

--3)Determine whether a significant outlier in terms of total funding (USD) exists among companies that offer financial
--services. Provide details pertaining to this outlier such as its country, status, year founded, and total funding (USD)

SELECT funding_total_usd,(funding_total_usd-AVG(funding_total_usd)
						  OVER())/STDDEV (funding_total_usd)OVER()
						  AS zscore_funding_total_usd 
						  FROM  public.finserv_new;

--finding the significant outlier from funding_total_usd
--answer: funding_total_usd=725000000,status =operating,country_code = USA,founded_year = null


SELECT * FROM (SELECT funding_total_usd,(funding_total_usd-AVG(funding_total_usd)
						  OVER())/STDDEV (funding_total_usd)OVER()
						  AS zscore_funding_total_usd 
						  FROM  public.finserv_new)AS outlier_funding_total_usd
						  WHERE zscore_funding_total_usd >2.576 OR zscore_funding_total_usd < -2.576;



--4)Excluding the significant outlier, provide insights on the company in terms of the usual 
--sources of financing for businesses that offer financial services

SELECT * FROM public.finserv_new
WHERE funding_total_usd = 725000000;

DELETE FROM public.finserv_new
WHERE funding_total_usd = 725000000;
